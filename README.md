# PeerSphere

A secure, hyper-local social platform exclusively for verified students to find genuine connections based on shared interests, hobbies, and academic pursuits within their university community.

## 🚀 Features

Verified Profile Creation: 
Interest-Based Profiles: 
Familiar Swiping Interface: 
Targeted Matching Algorithm: 
: 

- **Verified Profile Creation** – Users must sign up and verify their identity using their official university email address. This ensures all users are genuine students from the same institution, creating a trusted and safe community. 
- **Interest-Based Profiles** – Users can build a profile that showcases their hobbies, academic course, society memberships, and other personal interests. 
- **Familiar Swiping Interface** – We use a low-pressure 'swipe-right-to-connect' and 'swipe-left-to-pass' mechanism. This familiar system removes the "fear of rejection" associated with in-person approaches, as users are only notified of a mutual interest. 
- **Targeted Matching Algorithm** – The platform displays profiles based on shared interests, course-mates, and other user-defined preferences, increasing the likelihood of a successful connection. 
- **Private Chat Functionality** – Once two users mutually "match", a private chat is unlocked, allowing them to communicate securely within the app. 

## 💡 Why PeerSphere?

Current platforms like Meetup and Bumble serve general populations. They lack the trust, verification, and closed-community focus that university students need, leaving a critical market gap. 

Our solution caters for only verified students from your institution, no strangers, just genuine peers from your campus. And you have the benefit of finding friends through shared hobbies, courses, and society memberships, not just location.
